# How to contribute

## Reporting issues
If you found a bug or issue with Pharo, please let us know. You can report bugs using the [issue tracker](https://github.com/pharo-project/pharo/issues).

### How to report a bug
*  Get the latest stable or latest development system, ideally using the latest virtual machine. Pharo Launcher, which you can get from the [download](https://pharo.org/download) page, finds the latest snapshot for you automatically. However, be careful: the "latest" version in the "Official distributions" section may **NOT** be the latest development system. Look for a separate section named something like "Pharo 8.0 (development version)".
*  Make sure that you can reproduce the bug.
*  Look for an existing bug report in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/pharo-project/pharo/issues).
*  Email the [pharo-dev](https://lists.pharo.org/mailman/listinfo/pharo-dev_lists.pharo.org) mailing list if you are not sure whether the behavior you see is a bug, or whether the bug is the same as an existing issue.
*  Open a new bug.
*  Include the image version, virtual machine version, OS version, and any other information someone else would need to reproduce the bug.
*  Some [bots](https://github.com/pharo-project/pharo/wiki/Issue-Tracker-Bots) are there to help you.
*  Follow your bug, so that you can verify and close it when it is fixed.
